        <h3>Git Commands and their uses</h3>
        <p><strong>Git is a version control system</strong> that records changes to a file or set of files over time so
            that we can recall specific version
            later and save them on a remote repository like Github.
        </p>
        <p>To use this version control system first we need to installed it
            in our local system.</p>
        <p><strong>Repository is a directory or storage space where our projects can live</strong></p>
        <p>Below are the git commands and their corresponding functionalities:</p>
